Created a clone of the 1976 breakout game in python using Turtle and time libraries.
Instructions To Play:
1. Move the paddle using the left and right arrow keys.
2. Hit the blocks with the ball to break them.
3. Each block has different point values:
    Yellow: 1
    Green: 3
    Orange: 5
    Red: 7
4. After clearing each level of blocks, the speed of the ball increases.
5. ENJOY!!!!!!
